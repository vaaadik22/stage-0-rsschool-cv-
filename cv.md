for(var tryCount = 1; tryCount < maxTryCount; tryCount++){

    if(userAnswer == answer){
        alert("Congratulations, you guessed it");
       
    } else if(userAnswer > answer){
        alert('You entered too large a number');

    } else if(userAnswer < answer){
        alert('You entered too little number');
